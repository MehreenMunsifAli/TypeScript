// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians: string[] = ["magi1", "magi2", "magi3"];

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
  magicians.forEach((magician) => {
    console.log(magician);
  });
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
  for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
    magicians[i] = magicians[i] + " The Great!";
  }
}

make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
